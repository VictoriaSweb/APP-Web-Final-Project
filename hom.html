        <h2>What is Islam?</h2>
        <p>
          Islam is a comprehensive monotheistic religion that originated in the 7th century CE with the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad in Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia. It is based on the belief in one God, Allah, and centers around the Quran, which is considered the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad. Muslims, the followers of Islam, adhere to a faith that guides their daily lives, spiritual practices, social justice principles, and community values.
